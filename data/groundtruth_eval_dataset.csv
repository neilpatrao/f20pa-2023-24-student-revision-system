Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output","Lukasz and Aidan contributed to improving results and accelerating research in the context of efficient inference and visualizations by designing and implementing tensor2tensor. This replaced their earlier codebase, leading to significant improvements in results and a massive acceleration in their research."
How do recurrent models factor computation along the symbol positions of input and output sequences?,"architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in","Recurrent models factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences by aligning the positions to steps in computation time.

What is the main difference between the Transformer model architecture and traditional models that use recurrent networks?,"Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building",The main difference between the Transformer model architecture and traditional models that use recurrent networks is that the Transformer model eschews recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. This allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.
How does the Transformer model reduce the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions compared to other models like ConvS2S and ByteNet?,"The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions","The Transformer model reduces the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions by reducing it to a constant number of operations. This is in contrast to models like ConvS2S and ByteNet where the number of operations grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. The Transformer achieves this reduction at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect counteracted with Multi-Head Attention."
What is the main difference between end-to-end memory networks and the Transformer model in terms of their approach to computing representations of input sequences?,"described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate","The main difference between end-to-end memory networks and the Transformer model in terms of their approach to computing representations of input sequences is that end-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism, while the Transformer model relies entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution."
What are the components of each layer in the encoder stack?,"connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1
Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:
The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-
wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head","Each layer in the encoder stack is composed of two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Each of these sub-layers is surrounded by a residual connection, followed by layer normalization. All sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512."
How does the decoder in the transformer model prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions?,"Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2
Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum

query with the corresponding key.
3.2.1
Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:","In Scaled Dot-Product Attention, the weights assigned to each value are computed using a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. This is done by computing the dot products of the query with all keys, dividing each by the square root of the dimension of the keys (dk), and then applying a softmax function. This results in a set of weights for the values. When multiple queries are processed simultaneously, they are packed together into a matrix Q, with the keys and values also packed into matrices K and V respectively. The matrix of outputs is then computed using these matrices."

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of
1
√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.
While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of","Additive attention and dot-product attention are two commonly used attention functions in the attention mechanism. Dot-product attention is identical to the given algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1/√dk. It computes the compatibility function using the dot product of the query and key, and is faster and more space-efficient in practice due to its implementation using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. On the other hand, additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While theoretically similar in complexity to dot-product attention, it can outperform dot-product attention without scaling for larger values of dk. However, it is not as efficient in terms of speed and space as dot-product attention."
Explain why scaling the dot products by 1/√dk is necessary in dot product attention for larger values of dk.,"dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of
dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by
1
√dk .
3.2.2
Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned
linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional

variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk
i=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.
4","Scaling the dot products by 1/√dk in dot product attention is necessary for larger values of dk because as dk increases, the dot products also increase in magnitude. This pushes the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients, which can lead to difficulties in learning. By scaling the dot products, this effect is counteracted, allowing the softmax function to operate in a more manageable range and facilitating more effective learning."

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use
dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost
is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

How does the Transformer model use multi-head attention in 'encoder-decoder attention' layers?,"is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.
3.2.3
Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
• In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to","In the 'encoder-decoder attention' layers of the Transformer model, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This setup allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence, mimicking the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models."
How do we prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property?,"encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.
3.3
Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters","To prevent leftward information flow in the decoder and preserve the auto-regressive property, we implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections."
"In the given context, what is the dimensionality of the inner-layer (dff) in the FFN equation provided?","FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dff = 2048.
3.4
Embeddings and Softmax
Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.

Positional Encoding
Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the
tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel",O(r · n · d)
Explain the rationale behind using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies for positional encodings in the encoder and decoder stacks.,"tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].
In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)
where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two","Sine and cosine functions of different frequencies are used for positional encodings in the encoder and decoder stacks because they allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions. This is due to the fact that for any fixed offset 'k', the positional encoding at position 'pos+k' can be represented as a linear function of the positional encoding at position 'pos'. This property is particularly useful in sequence transduction tasks where relative positions of the tokens in the sequence are important. The wavelengths of the sinusoids form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π, providing a rich set of positional information for the model to learn from. This approach was chosen over learned positional embeddings after experimentation showed it to be effective."
What were the results of using learned positional embeddings compared to sinusoidal positional embeddings in the context of PEpos?,"PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.
4
Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.","The use of learned positional embeddings and sinusoidal positional embeddings in the context of PEpos produced nearly identical results. However, the sinusoidal version was chosen because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training."
"Explain how the path length between long-range dependencies in a network affects the ability to learn such dependencies, and compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of different layer types.","One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.
As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of","The path length between long-range dependencies in a network significantly impacts the ability to learn such dependencies. The shorter the paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies. This is because shorter paths allow for quicker and more efficient propagation of signals in both forward and backward directions during the learning process. 

When comparing the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of different layer types, a self-attention layer has an advantage. It connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, allowing for shorter path lengths and thus easier learning of long-range dependencies. On the other hand, a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations, which can result in longer path lengths and potentially make learning long-range dependencies more challenging. 

Therefore, the type of layer used in a network can significantly affect the maximum path length and consequently the ability to learn long-range dependencies. This is an important consideration when designing networks for tasks that require understanding of long-range dependencies."
"In terms of computational complexity, why are self-attention layers faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d?","executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence
6
length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,","Self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d because self-attention layers can process all positions in parallel, requiring O(1) executed operations. On the other hand, recurrent layers require O(n) sequential operations. This is often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece and byte-pair representations. Furthermore, to improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position, increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r)."
"What is the complexity of separable convolutions in terms of k, n, and d?","positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.
As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.

the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).
5.3
Optimizer
We used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
lrate = d−0.5
model · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)
(3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.
5.4
Regularization
We employ three types of regularization during training:

Residual Dropout
We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the
sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the
positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of
Pdrop = 0.1.
Label Smoothing
During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This
hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].
Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.

checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This","In Table 3 rows (A), varying the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions has a noticeable impact on model quality. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads. This suggests that there is an optimal number of attention heads and key and value dimensions for achieving the best model quality."
What does the observation in Table 3 rows (B) suggest about the compatibility function in the model?,"attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.

English Constituency Parsing
To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English
constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence","The observation in Table 3 rows (B) suggests that the compatibility function in the model is complex and may require a more sophisticated function than dot product for determining compatibility. It also indicates that reducing the attention key size negatively impacts the model quality. Furthermore, larger models perform better and the use of dropout helps in preventing overfitting. The use of learned positional embeddings instead of sinusoidal positional encoding yields nearly identical results to the base model."

Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.
We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs","The Transformer model offers several advantages over architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers for translation tasks.
