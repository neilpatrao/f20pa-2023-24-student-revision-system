Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output","Lukasz and Aidan made significant contributions towards the design and implementation of tensor2tensor, which led to improved results and accelerated research in sequence modeling. However, the context does not provide specific details about their contributions. It only mentions that they spent long days designing and implementing various parts of tensor2tensor, replacing an earlier codebase, and improving results. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be given without additional information."
"Given the context about recurrent models and attention mechanisms in sequence modeling, explain how recent work has addressed the fundamental constraint of sequential computation in recurrent models?","architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in","Recent research has addressed the fundamental constraint of sequential computation in recurrent models by introducing Transformer architectures [37], which replace the recurrent nature with self-attention mechanisms. In these models, each position in a sequence attends to all other positions, allowing for parallelization during both training and inference. This leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency and handling longer sequences compared to traditional recurrent models."
"In the given context, what model architecture is proposed to rely entirely on an attention mechanism for drawing global dependencies between input and output sequences?","Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building",The Transformer model architecture is proposed in the context to rely entirely on an attention mechanism for drawing global dependencies between input and output sequences.
"In the context of Transformer models, how does self-attention (also known as intra-attention) reduce the number of operations required to relate signals from different positions compared to ConvS2S and ByteNet?","The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions","In Transformer models, self-attention (also known as intra-attention) reduces the number of operations required to relate signals from different positions compared to ConvS2S and ByteNet by allowing all positions of an input sequence to attend to all other positions. This is in contrast to ConvS2S and ByteNet, which require a growing number of operations as the distance between positions increases. Self-attention achieves this through parallel computation of attention scores for all position pairs, resulting in a constant number of operations regardless of the distance between positions."
Which model is the first transduction model to rely entirely on self-attention for input and output representation without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution?,"described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate",The Transformer is the first transduction model to rely entirely on self-attention for input and output representation without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.

self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.

Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:","In the context of the Transformer model, the self-attention mechanism is responsible for the multi-head attention components in both the encoder and decoder. Point-wise, fully connected layers are used after each self-attention layer in the encoder and decoder for further processing."
"Given the context about the encoder and decoder stacks in a transformer model, identify and explain the function of the third sub-layer in each decoder layer.","connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1
Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:
The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-
wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head","The third sub-layer in each decoder layer is responsible for multi-head attention mechanism. This sub-layer helps the decoder to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions and relations. It complements the first two sub-layers, which are a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple feed-forward network in each decoder layer, respectively."
"Given the context about a decoder in a transformer model, which attention mechanism is used specifically in the decoder to help generate the next word based on the previous words?","Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2
Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum

of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.
3.2.1
Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:","To perform Scaled Dot-Product Attention, you need to follow these steps:
1. Compute the dot product of queries (Q) and keys (K).
2. Divide each dot product by the square root of the dimension of keys (dk).
3. Apply a softmax function on the results to obtain weights.
4. Multiply the weights with values (V).
5. Sum up the results across all heads to get the final output."
"Given the context about Attention mechanisms in deep learning, compare and contrast the computational complexities and practical efficiencies of dot-product attention and additive attention. Which mechanism is preferred for larger values of dk?","into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of
1
√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.
While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of","For larger values of dk in the context of attention mechanisms in deep learning, additive attention may outperform dot-product attention without scaling due to its ability to process larger key dimensions. However, dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient in practice due to its implementation using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. Theoretically, both have similar complexities, but the practical efficiency of dot-product attention makes it a preferred choice for larger values of dk."
"Given a multi-head attention mechanism with dmodel, dk, and dv dimensions, why do we scale the dot products by 1/√dk in large value of dk contexts?","dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of
dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by
1
√dk .
3.2.2
Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned
linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional

depicted in Figure 2.
Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation
subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use

is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

3.2.3
Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
• In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to",Each position in the encoder attends to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder in the self-attention layers of the encoder.
"Given the context of an encoder-decoder model with position-wise self-attention and feed-forward networks, how does the scaled dot-product attention in the decoder prevent leftward information flow while maintaining the auto-regressive property?","encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.
3.3
Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters","The scaled dot-product attention in the decoder prevents leftward information flow by masking out illegal connections during the attention calculation. This is done inside the softmax function, where all values corresponding to positions before the current position are set to negative infinity. This ensures that the decoder only attends to information up to and including its current position, preserving the auto-regressive property."
"Given the context about a neural network model using ReLU activation functions, convolutions, and learned embeddings, calculate the dimensionality of the inner-layer (dff) and the dimensionality of the output (dmodel). Also, explain how the weights are shared between different layers.","FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dff = 2048.
3.4
Embeddings and Softmax
Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.

Positional Encoding
Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the
tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel","The complexity per layer for a Self-Attention (restricted) layer with a sequence length of 10, representation dimension of 512, and neighborhood size of 32 is calculated as O(r · n · d), where r is the neighborhood size, n is the sequence length, and d is the representation dimension. Substituting the given values, we get a complexity of O(32 · 10 · 512) = O(163840)."
"In the given context, which functions are used for generating positional encodings in this specific model?","tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add ""positional encodings"" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].
In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)
where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two","In the given context, the functions used for generating positional encodings in this specific model are sine and cosine functions of different frequencies."
"Why was self-attention chosen over recurrent and convolutional layers in this context, considering computational complexity and parallelization capabilities?","PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.

Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.","Self-attention was chosen over recurrent and convolutional layers due to its superior computational complexity and parallelization capabilities in this context, as outlined in the text. The experiment results showed that self-attention and learned positional embeddings produced identical results, but sinusoidal positional embeddings may allow the model to extrapolate to longer sequences. Self-attention has a lower total computational complexity per layer compared to recurrent and convolutional layers. Additionally, it allows for more parallelization as it requires fewer sequential operations."
"Given two types of layers in a neural network, a self-attention layer and a recurrent layer, which one requires fewer sequential operations on average to connect all positions within the layer? And why does this difference impact the ability to learn long-range dependencies in the network?","One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.
As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of","A self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, while a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations on average. This difference impacts the ability to learn long-range dependencies in the network because self-attention layers can process information from different positions in the input sequence simultaneously, allowing for shorter paths between long-range dependencies. In contrast, recurrent layers process information sequentially, which can result in longer paths and potentially hinder the learning of long-range dependencies."
"Given a sequence length n and representation dimensionality d, under what conditions are self-attention layers faster than recurrent layers in terms of computational complexity? Also suggest a method to improve the performance for long sequences.","executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence

length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,","Self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers in terms of computational complexity when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d. This is because self-attention operations can be performed in parallel, while recurrent layers require sequential operations. However, for very long sequences, the computational cost of self-attention can become prohibitive due to the quadratic time complexity. To improve performance, one approach is to restrict self-attention to consider only a neighborhood of size r around the respective output position, increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r). This would reduce the number of computations required and could be an area for further research."

between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.
As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.

Training","The complexity difference between using contiguous kernels with O(n/k) layers and dilated convolutions with O(logk(n)) layers, assuming n = 1000 and k = 5, can be calculated as follows: 

For contiguous kernels, the complexity is O(n * (n/k) * d), where d is the depth of each convolutional layer. Since there are n/k layers, the total complexity is O(n^2 * d). 

For dilated convolutions, the complexity is O(n * logk(n) * d). Substituting n = 1000 and k = 5, we get a complexity of O(1000 * log5(1000) * d). 

Comparing these complexities, we can see that the complexity for contiguous kernels is greater than that for dilated convolutions. Specifically, the complexity for contiguous kernels is approximately 25 times greater than that for dilated convolutions when n = 1000 and k = 5."

Training
This section describes the training regime for our models.
5.1
Training Data and Batching
We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT
2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece
vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
target tokens.
5.2
Hardware and Schedule
We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using","The English-German model was trained on the WMT 2014 English-German dataset, which consists of approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs. The vocabulary size for this dataset is about 37,000 tokens."
"Given the context, what was the total time taken to train the base models and the big models respectively?","target tokens.
5.2
Hardware and Schedule
We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).
5.3
Optimizer
We used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
lrate = d−0.5
model · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)
(3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.
5.4
Regularization
We employ three types of regularization during training:
7","The base models were trained for 12 hours or 100,000 steps, with each step taking approximately 0.4 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken to train the base models is 12 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 432000 seconds. The big models were trained for 3.5 days or 300,000 steps, with each step taking approximately 1 second. Therefore, the total time taken to train the big models is 3.5 days * 86400 seconds/day = 2976000 seconds."

Pdrop = 0.1.
Label Smoothing

hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

Results

Machine Translation
On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)
in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is","The big Transformer model outperforms the base model on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task by a significant margin, as indicated by their respective BLEU scores. The big model achieved a score of 28.4, which is more than 1.3 points higher than the base model's score of 27.3. This improvement can be attributed to the larger model size and the use of techniques like residual dropout and label smoothing during training."
"Based on the context, which model achieved a higher BLEU score in the English-to-French translation task and at what cost?","in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is
listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model
surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of
the competitive models.
On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,
outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the
previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used
dropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.
For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which
were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We","The 'big model' achieved a higher BLEU score of 41.0 in the English-to-French translation task, which is more than the previously reported state-of-the-art score of 28.4. However, it's important to note that the big model was trained at less than 1/4 the cost of the previous state-of-the-art model."
"Based on the context, which hyperparameters were used for the base and big models during training, and how were they chosen? Also, estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model based on the provided information.","For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which
were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We
used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].
Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.

Model Variations
To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model","For the base models, the hyperparameters were chosen by averaging the last 5 checkpoints written at 10-minute intervals. Specifically, no individual hyperparameter is mentioned in the context for the base model. For big models, the hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set based on the last 20 checkpoints. The provided context does not mention which hyperparameters were used for the base and big models during training except for beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used for the base and big models from the given context. As for the estimation of floating point operations, the context mentions that the number of floating point operations is estimated by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU. However, no specific numbers are provided in the context for these quantities."

checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This","The row in Table 3 where the attention key size (dk) is reduced and the model quality drops can be identified as row (B). The values for this row are: 16, 5.16, 25.1, 58, 32, 5.01, 25.4, 60."
"Given the context about the Transformer model's performance on attention key size and other factors, create a question related to English constituency parsing.","attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.

English Constituency Parsing
To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English
constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence","Based on the context provided, which factor in the Transformer model setup could potentially improve English constituency parsing performance despite the structural constraints and longer output length compared to the input?"

Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014

model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.
We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs",The researchers achieved a new state of the art on WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks.
