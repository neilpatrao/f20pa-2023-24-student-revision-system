Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions",The Transformer model proposed by Vaswani et al. is a type of network architecture that uses only attention mechanisms instead of complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks with an encoder and decoder connected through an attention mechanism.

to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,

Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output",Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent neural networks were mentioned as state-of-the-art approaches for sequence modeling and transduction problems in the context of this paper.
How does the sequential nature of recurrent models impact their computational efficiency and parallelization within training examples?,"architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in","The sequential nature of recurrent models makes them less computationally efficient and harder to parallelize within training examples compared to other models. This is because they process input sequences one symbol at a time, generating hidden states based on the previous state and current input. This inherent sequentiality prevents parallelization, which can be problematic for longer sequence lengths due to memory constraints limiting batching across examples. Recent advancements in recurrent models, such as factorization tricks and conditional computation, have helped improve computational efficiency while maintaining model performance."
