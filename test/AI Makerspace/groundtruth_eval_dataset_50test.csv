Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output",The paper 'Efficient Inference and Visualizations for Tensor2Tensor' was presented at the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017).
How does the sequential nature of recurrent models impact their computational efficiency and parallelization within training examples?,"architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in","The sequential nature of recurrent models makes them less computationally efficient and harder to parallelize within training examples compared to other models. This is because they process input sequences one symbol at a time, generating hidden states based on the previous state and current input. This inherent sequentiality prevents parallelization, which can be problematic for longer sequence lengths due to memory constraints limiting batching across examples. Recent advancements in recurrent models, such as factorization tricks and conditional computation, have helped improve computational efficiency while maintaining model performance."
"In the given context, explain how the Transformer model architecture differs from traditional models in handling dependencies between input and output sequences?","Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building","The Transformer model architecture differs from traditional models in handling dependencies between input and output sequences by relying solely on attention mechanisms instead of recurrence. In contrast, traditional models often use recurrent networks to capture dependencies. The use of attention mechanisms in the Transformer allows for more parallelization as the model can process all positions in the sequence at once, unlike recurrent models which process one position at a time. This leads to significant improvements in translation quality and faster training times."
"In the context of Transformer models, how does self-attention reduce the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions compared to ConvS2S and ByteNet?","The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions","In Transformer models, self-attention reduces the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions compared to ConvS2S and ByteNet by allowing all positions in a sequence to attend to all other positions. This is in contrast to ConvS2S and ByteNet where the number of operations grows linearly or logarithmically with the distance between positions. Self-attention achieves this reduction by performing the computation in parallel for all positions, making it more efficient in handling long-range dependencies."
Which attention mechanism does the Transformer model rely solely on for computing its input and output representations?,"described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate",The Transformer model relies solely on self-attention for computing its input and output representations.

self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1
Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:","In the context of the Transformer model, the encoder is responsible for processing the input sequence (x1, ..., xn) to obtain a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). The decoder, on the other hand, generates the output sequence (y1, ..., ym) one element at a time based on the previously generated symbols and the sequence of continuous representations z."

respectively.
3.1
Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:
The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-
wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head","The third sub-layer in the decoder is responsible for implementing a multi-head attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the decoder to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions and relations. It complements the self-attention mechanism in the encoder, which attends to the relationships between different parts of the input sequence. By having this additional attention mechanism in the decoder, it can better generate target sequences based on the encoded context."
"Given the decoder architecture described, which sub-layer in each decoder layer performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack?","Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2
Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum

of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.
3.2.1
Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:","The weights on the values in Scaled Dot-Product Attention are obtained by computing the dot product between the queries (Q) and keys (K), dividing each result by the square root of the dimension of the keys (dk), and applying a softmax function to obtain the probabilities. The output is then computed as a weighted sum based on these probabilities."
"Given the context about attention mechanisms in deep learning, which mechanism is more space-efficient and faster in practice for larger values of dk?","into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:

(1)
The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of
1
√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.
While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of","For larger values of dk, dot-product attention is more space-efficient and faster in practice due to its ability to be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code."
"Given the context about Multi-Head Attention with dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk, explain why the dot products between queries (q) and keys (k) can grow large in magnitude when dk is large. Provide an example to illustrate this concept.","dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of
dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by
1
√dk .
3.2.2
Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned
linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional

4","In the context of Multi-Head Attention with dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk, the dot products between queries (q) and keys (k) can grow large in magnitude when dk is large because the variance of the dot product of two random variables, each with mean 0 and variance 1, is equal to dk. When dk is large, this variance results in larger dot products, which can push the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. This can negatively impact the learning process during training. To mitigate this issue, the dot products are scaled by 1/√dk."

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use
dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost
is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.
3.2.3
Applications of Attention in our Model","The total number of parameters for the projections W Qi, W Ki, W Vi, and W O can be calculated as follows: For each head i, there are three projection matrices: W Qi (Q queries), W Ki (keys), and W Vi (values). Each matrix has dimensions dmodel (output dimension) x dk (query/key/value dimension for that head). So the number of parameters for each matrix is dmodel * dk. Since there are h heads, the total number of parameters for all matrices is 3 * h * (dmodel * dk). Substituting the given values, we get: 3 * 8 * (64 * 64) = 12288 * 64 = 786432."
"In which part(s) of the Transformer model does multi-head attention function with queries coming from a previous layer, allowing every position to attend over all positions in that layer?","is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.
3.2.3
Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
• In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to","In the encoder-decoder attention layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer and every position in the decoder attends over all positions in the input sequence."
How does position-wise feed-forward networks in a Transformer model prevent leftward information flow in the decoder?,"encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.
3.3
Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters","Position-wise feed-forward networks in a Transformer model prevent leftward information flow in the decoder by applying separate and identical feed-forward networks to each position. This is done to maintain the auto-regressive property, as self-attention in the decoder allows each position to attend to all positions up to and including that position. To prevent illegal connections, scaled dot-product attention masks out values corresponding to these connections by setting them to negative infinity."
"Given the context about a neural network model with two convolutional layers, each performing a kernel size 1 transformation but with different parameters, and having input and output dimensions of dmodel = 512 and an inner-layer dimension of dff = 2048. Additionally, the model uses learned embeddings for input and output tokens, shares the same weight matrix between the embedding layers and pre-softmax linear transformation, and multiplies those weights by √dmodel in the embedding layers. Find the purpose of multiplying the weights by √dmodel in the embedding layers.","FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2

While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dff = 2048.
3.4
Embeddings and Softmax
Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.
5
Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations","The purpose of multiplying the weights by √dmodel in the embedding layers is to adjust the scale of the embeddings. This is often referred to as 'weight normalization' or 'learning rate scheduling'. By scaling the weights, the model can ensure that each embedding vector contributes equally to the final output, regardless of the dimensionality of the embedding space (dmodel). This helps prevent issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients during training."
"Why was self-attention chosen over recurrent and convolutional layers in this context, considering computational complexity and parallelizability?","PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.
4
Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.","Self-attention was chosen over recurrent and convolutional layers due to its superior computational complexity and parallelizability in this context, as outlined in the text. The authors found that self-attention produced nearly identical results with learned positional embeddings but allowed for extrapolation to longer sequences. Recurrent and convolutional layers have a higher sequential computation requirement compared to self-attention, which can be computed in parallel."
Given two types of neural network layers - self-attention and recurrent - calculate the difference in the minimum number of sequential operations required for each to establish a connection between any pair of input and output positions.,"One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.
As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of","The minimum number of sequential operations required for a self-attention layer to establish a connection between any pair of input and output positions is constant, while for a recurrent layer it is O(n)."
"Given a sequence length n and a kernel width k less than n, calculate the minimum number of convolutional layers required to connect all input-output pairs in the case of contiguous kernels.","executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence
6
length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,",The minimum number of convolutional layers required to connect all input-output pairs in the case of contiguous kernels is O(n/k).
"Given the context about convolutional layers and their complexity in neural networks, calculate the complexity reduction achieved by using separable convolutions instead of regular convolutions when k = n.","positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.
As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.
5
Training","When k = n in separable convolutions, the complexity reduction achieved compared to regular convolutions is significant. According to the context, the complexity of a regular convolutional layer is O(k · n · d + n · d2). However, with separable convolutions, the complexity reduces to O(k · n · d), which is less than the complexity of a single regular convolutional layer. This reduction in complexity can be attributed to the fact that separable convolutions consist of a depthwise convolution (self-attention) and a point-wise convolution (point-wise feed-forward layer). The self-attention layer allows for more interpretable models by learning different tasks, and many attention heads exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences."

Training

Training Data and Batching
We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT

vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
target tokens.

5.2
Hardware and Schedule
We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).
5.3
Optimizer
We used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
lrate = d−0.5
model · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)
(3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,

the competitive models.
On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,
outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the
previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used

"Based on the context, which component of the Transformer model were the researchers focusing on when they conducted their experiments?","For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which
were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We
used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].
Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.

checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This",The best BLEU score was achieved by setting the number of attention heads to 32 and the attention key and value dimensions to 16 each. The corresponding BLEU score is 25.8.

In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.

English Constituency Parsing
To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English
constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence","Determining compatibility between attention key sizes and model quality is not a straightforward task due to several reasons. Firstly, as shown in the context, reducing the attention key size dk can negatively impact model quality (as observed in rows B). This suggests that there might be complex interactions between attention key sizes and model performance that cannot be captured by a simple dot product compatibility function. Secondly, the context indicates that too many attention heads can also degrade model quality. Therefore, finding the optimal balance between attention key size and number of heads is not a trivial task. This complexity makes it necessary to explore more sophisticated methods for determining compatibility."

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence

We trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the

Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural","Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning (CSSL) and traditional Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG) handle long-term dependencies differently due to their underlying architectures. CSSL, as proposed in [9], uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sequence processing. CNNs are particularly effective at handling long-range dependencies by applying local filters across the entire input sequence. This allows CSSL to capture long-term context without the need for explicit modeling of dependencies like in PCFG grammars.

On the other hand, traditional PCFG grammars, as discussed in [14], rely on probabilistic models to generate sequences. They model dependencies between symbols using a set of production rules and probability distributions. However, these models can struggle with long-term dependencies due to the local nature of their production rules and the difficulty of estimating long-range probabilities.

In summary, CSSL's use of convolutional neural networks enables it to capture long-term dependencies more effectively than traditional PCFG grammars by allowing for the processing of local context across the entire sequence."

(2014) to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, some neurons during training with a specified dropout rate. This forces the network to learn more robust features and reduces the co-adaptation of neurons, thereby preventing overreliance on any single feature or neuron. Dropout is applied at each hidden layer during training and turned off during testing.

On the other hand, end-to-end memory networks proposed by Sainbayar Sukhbaatar et al. (2015) use a different approach to prevent overfitting. Instead of randomly dropping out neurons, they introduce an external memory that stores relevant information from the input sequence and can be accessed during the processing of subsequent sequences. This allows the network to maintain contextual information across time and learn more complex dependencies, reducing the need for large neural networks and improving generalization performance."
"In the context of network research as discussed in the papers [36], [37], [38], [39], and [40], identify and explain a specific contribution each paper made towards advancing neural networks for computer vision, machine translation, or recurrent models.","networks.
